## Debugging with the F5 Key

Using the F5 key starts a special tool called the debugger. 

The first time you hit F5, look at the top of the IDE window. You might see a
selection window that reads "Select Debugger". Select the first option, "Python
Debugger". Then, on the next window, select "Python File. Debug currently active
Python file". After that, you will see the debug bar:

We will learn all of the features for the debugger later, but for now you just
need to know that you press the red square to exit your program, and the green
circle to re-run it.
